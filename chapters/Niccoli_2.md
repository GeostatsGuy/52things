# Computer vision for fault interpretation
     
Matteo Niccoli

Chapter needs to be adapted (and shortened) for the book from [this Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mycarta/faults/blob/master/fun_with_faults.ipynb)

Small improvements to the code would be nice too.

Will pick it up after Calgary Geoconvention 2018
