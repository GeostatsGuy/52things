# Computer vision for fault interpretation
     
Matteo Niccoli

Chapter needs to be adapted (and shortened) for the book from [this Jupyter notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mycarta/faults/blob/master/fun_with_faults.ipynb).

Also, planned small improvements to the code include:
- add calculation of dip done in Python
- filter dip angles based on rather than standar deviation

Longer term imporvements:
- eliminating skeleton artifacts (minutiae)
- using amplitude or discontinuity slices
- semiautomatic frequency filtering of acquisition footprint

Will pick it up after Calgary Geoconvention 2018
